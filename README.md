# Tekton
Repository with Tekton pipelines

# Why?  

I don't like Jenkins ecosystem. I am looking for alternative solutions for CI / CD. I am researching Tekton to build native pipelines for Kubernetes.

# Installation

```sh
kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
```
